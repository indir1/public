Example of Full and Collapsed IPv6 Address
Here is an example of a full IPv6 address:

FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
It shows a 128-bit address in eight 16-bit blocks in the format global:subnet:interface.

Here is an example of a collapsed IPv6 address:
FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
The :: (consecutive colons) notation can be used to represent four successive 16-bit blocks that contain zeros. When SAS software encounters a collapsed IP address, it reconstitutes the address to the required 128-bit address in eight 16-bit blocks.

Example of an IPv6 Address That Includes a Port Number
Here is an example of an IP address that contains a port number:
[2001:db8:0:1]:80
The brackets are necessary only if also specifying a port number. Brackets are used to separate the address from the port number. If no port number is used, the brackets can be omitted.

As an alternative, the block that contains a zero can be collapsed. Here is an example:

[2001:db8::1]:80
Example of an IPv6 Address That Includes a URL
Here is an example of an IP address that contains a URL:
http://[2001:db8:0:1]:80
The http:// prefix specifies a URL. The brackets are necessary only if also specifying a port number. Brackets are used to separate the address from the port number. If no port number is used, the brackets can be omitted.
